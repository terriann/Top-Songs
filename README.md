Quick Template
==============

Quick template to build a static site using backbone, grunt, scss &amp; twig.js

This project will allow you to edit the source files (located in `www/src`) and leverage different grunt modules to speed up your development.  The modules already included in the package.json file are as follows:

- Grunt watch `grunt-contrib-watch`
- Grunt clean `grunt-contrib-clean`
- Grunt concat `grunt-contrib-concat`
- Grunt copy `grunt-contrib-copy`
- Grunt sass `grunt-contrib-sass`
- Grunt cssmin `grunt-contrib-cssmin`
- Grunt uglify `grunt-contrib-uglify`
- Grunt includes `grunt-includes`

The `Gruntfile.js` included is designed to do the following:

- **Clean**  
Purges files based on the following rules  
`www/build/js`  
`www/build/css` 
`www/build/images`  
`www/src/sass/compiled/*.css`  
This effectively cleans our the workspace to make sure only current files are affected by the next steps
- **sass**  
This runs all `.scss` the files in `www/src/sass/` directory through the SASS copiler and outputs each file with the same name but a `.css` extension into the `www/src/sass/compiled` directory 
- **concat**  
Concat concatinate all the files in directories into a single file **SHOULD EXPLAIN MORE**
- **copy**  
Copies files in src that need to be included in build based on the following rules  
`www/src/fonts/*` move to `www/build/css/fonts/`  
`www/src/images/*` move to `www/build/images/`
- **includes**
**I don't like how this is setup, should fix it**
- **cssmin**
Runs the aggregated file generated by `concat` through a css minifier.  Both the aggregate and the minified file are stored in the `www/build/css/` directory as `style.min.css` and `style.css` you should update your HTML file to use the one more approprite for your project
- **uglify**  
**Explain this one** 


## Setup For new Repo

Clone this project into the directory for your new project

	git clone git@github.com:terriann/quick-template.git .

Set Origin URL to new projects repo

	`git remote set-url origin the_url_of_your_repo_here`

## Getting Grunt Going

In your command line run `npm init` and walk through the process to setup your `packages.json` file.

Run `npm update` to update all the required Grunt node modules

Now you can run `grunt`

While you're working keep `grunt watch` running in the background and whenever a template, js or scss file is modified it will run the required steps to update the build directory for testing in your browser

**TADA! Now you're ready to rock 'n roll**

## Hook it up with some Phonegap

The main reason I created this template with these specific Grunt modules is so I could build a complete static site to integrate into a Phone Gap app

[Insert Phonegap instructions here at some point]
