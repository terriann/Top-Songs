Quick Static Site (QSS)
==============

Quick static site is a website template to build a static website. It's a perfect developer tool to be able to stay organized when working on small client sites and PhoneGap projects.

QSS includes basic html, scss files and the [backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/), [twig.js](https://github.com/justjohn/twig.js/) & [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) javascript libraries to get you started.

##How would I use it?

###Build a small static site
Have a client that needs a small website, maybe a single page or just a few HMTL pages? If you're used to includes for reusable code and sass to organize & maintain your styles and you want to easily develop but be able to support a site with minified CSS and Javascript this project makes it easy to do so! All you have to do is upload the content in the `www/build` directory and they won't even need a fancy hosting plan.

###Build the content for a PhoneGap app
Phone gap is neat but you need to serve static HTML, so no server side functionality allowed and again no includes.  Just like described above for static websites you can use this template to build easily maintainable static content to serve inside the PhoneGap app.  Still need dyamic content form a webserver? Use javascript to fetch content from your webserver. Bam, done.

##How to Use QSS
This project will allow you to edit the source files (located in `www/src`) and leverage different grunt modules to speed up your development.  The modules already included in the package.json file are as follows:

- Grunt watch `grunt-contrib-watch`
- Grunt clean `grunt-contrib-clean`
- Grunt concat `grunt-contrib-concat`
- Grunt copy `grunt-contrib-copy`
- Grunt sass `grunt-contrib-sass`
- Grunt cssmin `grunt-contrib-cssmin`
- Grunt uglify `grunt-contrib-uglify`
- Grunt includes `grunt-includes`

The `Gruntfile.js` included is designed to do the following:

- **Clean**  
Purges files based on the following rules  
`www/build/js`  
`www/build/css` 
`www/build/images`  
`www/src/sass/compiled/*.css`  
This effectively cleans our the workspace to make sure only current files are affected by the next steps
- **sass**  
This runs all `.scss` the files in `www/src/sass/` directory through the SASS copiler and outputs each file with the same name but a `.css` extension into the `www/src/sass/compiled` directory 
- **concat**  
Concat concatinate all the files in directories into a single file **SHOULD EXPLAIN MORE**
- **copy**  
Copies files in src that need to be included in build based on the following rules  
`www/src/fonts/*` move to `www/build/css/fonts/`  
`www/src/images/*` move to `www/build/images/`
- **includes**
**I don't like how this is setup, should fix it**
- **cssmin**
Runs the aggregated file generated by `concat` through a css minifier.  Both the aggregate and the minified file are stored in the `www/build/css/` directory as `style.min.css` and `style.css` you should update your HTML file to use the one more approprite for your project
- **uglify**  
**Explain this one** 


## Setup For new Repo

Clone this project into the directory for your new project

	git clone git@github.com:terriann/quick-template.git .

Set Origin URL to new projects repo

	`git remote set-url origin the_url_of_your_repo_here`

## Getting Grunt Going

In your command line run `npm init` and walk through the process to setup your `packages.json` file.

Run `npm update` to update all the required Grunt node modules

Now you can run `grunt`

While you're working keep `grunt watch` running in the background and whenever a template, js or scss file is modified it will run the required steps to update the build directory for testing in your browser

**TADA! Now you're ready to rock 'n roll**

## Hook it up with some Phonegap

The main reason I created this template with these specific Grunt modules is so I could build a complete static site to integrate into a Phone Gap app

[Insert Phonegap instructions here at some point]


##Additional Information
###Why did you make this project?
I initially created this as a base template for a few projects I was working on. The first was a PhoneGap app and then a client site that needed a couple simple pages of content. I thought this was a clever way to feel like I was developing an easily scalable & maintainable project and still just end up with simple HTML, CSS and JS files to upload at the end.

###But I don't need everything include
Okay, then remove it! When youre learning new things it can be frustrating that many tutorials are either for complete noobs or for the people with higher level experience.  I think this template does a nice job of being a healthy balance between bare bones and entirely too robust.
